## Guide For Downloading Mixamo Data

1. Go to [mixamo website](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) and sign up for free. Then logo in and you will see a webpage where you can choose character/animation and see the result.
2. Prepare the download script, which is originally posted on an online community, see [here](https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/community-content-tools-and-tutorials/1376068-script-mixamo-download-script). Please read the instructions at the head of the code before using it, since there are many arguments you can set to satisfy your own need.
3. Choose the character you want to download, and the animation genre (by clicking __search__) if you do not want to download all the animations.  _NOTE: downloading all the animations requires a lot of time._
4. Then choose an animation and click __DOWNLOAD__ on the right of the page. Next, set the arguments and click DOWNLOAD this example. The page will remember your settings for  all your following automatic downloads. _NOTE : set Skin=Without Skin if you only need skeleton, it will save you a lot of space_.
5. Set your browser NOT to ask where to save files on each download.
6. Finally, open your browser console (``crtl+shift+J`` or ```F12``` in Google Chrome) and paste the downloading script into it. Then automatic downloading will begin.
